Project Management - PERT/GANTT/WBS

It is intended with the project of this unit that the students create the documentation to support the management of a software project. The main objective of the unit is to enable controlled monitoring of the implementation project.

To implement the project the student should consider that you have 3 computer engineers at a cost Man / Hour of 120 euros / hour and a Project Manager at 150 euros / hour. This already includes all office expenses, subsidies and equipment. The Manager is 50% interested in this project.
Here's the list of items to include in the report:

1. Hierarchical tree of modules. With Times per task / day (8 hours)
2. Budget analysis. They only consider receiving the last 40% of the money in the second year because it is a funded project and the remaining payment comes one year after the start. CachFlow map considering that 3 desktop computers have to be purchased. Price / Computer 2000 euros.

3. Map PERT and respective analysis of times of activities. (Durations have to be calculated previously based on optimistic and pessimistic and common but do not consider critical chain) - Map must have LST, LFT, LSS, EFT put in the MAP with the square brackets.

4. Correct PERT to place dependencies between activities considering Resources.
(We want dependencies on activities of the same resources, put activities of name buffer with 50% size of each activity, only in the critical path, critical path that was affected by the dependencies caused by the resources)
6. 1 Activity Report and 1 Simulated Progress Report in the middle of TD. You must have at least one overdue activity and one with overtime.
